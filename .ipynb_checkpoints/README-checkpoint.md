# python-api-challenge

## Background

I used two API's two solve WeatherPy (OpenWeatherMap API) and VacationPy (Google Places API).

**WeatherPy** I created a random list of 500+ cities by using the CitiPy library and OpenWeatherMap API. The nearest city to the coordinates gave me an output city. I used Jupyter notebook and Pandas. My API key is in config.py. I also output that data to cities.csv. I saved each of the 4 scatter plots in the images folder.

**VacationPy**
